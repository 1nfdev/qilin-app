Additional Grant of Patent

A perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable license, under any necessary claims, to
make, have made, use, import and otherwise transfer the Qilin software, is
hereby granted to each recipient ("you") of the Qilin software distributed by
Bartosz Łaniewski.

The license granted hereunder will terminate, automatically and without notice,
if you (or any of your subsidiaries, corporate affiliates or agents) initiate
directly or indirectly, or take a direct financial interest in.

(1) A written permission from the main maintainer of Qilin software is necessary
    if a recipient or contributor decides to sell or publish the software on any
    store.

(2) This software may not be sold to a third party nor redistributed or
    otherwise conveyed in the original form. Therefore, if important changes
    were made, the contributor can ask for donations.

(3) No recipient or contributor is allowed to ask and receive any donations for
    his copy of Qilin software if the design has not been changed - the entire
    design has been created by and is the property of Bartosz Łaniewski.
